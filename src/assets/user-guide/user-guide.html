    <h1>Analytics Builder User Guide</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    The Analytics Builder provides a graphical interface which is used to
    configure the analytics which are supplied with the Industry Analytics Kit. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

    </a> <br>
    <br>
    The builder consists of five main areas :<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Navigation Panel</li>
    </ul>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The navigation bar at the top
    of the screen provides common functionality such as clearing the
    configuration, loading saved configurations, saving new configurations and
    loading sample configurations. <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Analytics Panel</li>
    </ul>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The analytics panel
    on the left of the screen displays the list of available analytics. These analytics
    have been categorised into groups according to their function.<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Configuration Panel</li>
    </ul>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the centre of
    the screen is the main configuration panel. This is the main work area which
    is used to create a new configuration or edit a previously saved
    configuration. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The configuration
    panel allows a user to drag in analytics, link them by channels and change
    the properties of analytics <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Documentation Panel</li>
    </ul>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the bottom of
    the screen is the documentation panel. This panel displays the documentation
    for the analytic which has been selected either in the Analytics Panel or in
    the main Configuration Panel <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Properties Panel</li>
    </ul>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; On the right of the
    screen is the Properties Panel. This either displays the Channel Properties
    if a channel has been selected in the main Configuration Panel or the
    Analytic Properties if an analytic has been selected<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <u>Analytic Samples</u><br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Analytics Builder is provided with three samples
    which can be loaded from the 'Samples' dropdown in the navigation bar.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hovering over these samples displays their short
    description.When a sample is clicked, it is automatically loaded and
    displayed in the Configuration Panel. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Missing Spikes</b> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This configuration consists of a Spike
    Analytic which is receiving data from a channel called <i>RAW_SENSOR_DATA</i>.
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The output from the Spike Analytic is
    being sent into the <b>Missing Data</b> Analytic which is sending the
    output to a <i>SENSOR_ANOMALIES</i> channel <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Peer Analysis</b> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>Average </b>analytic receives
    raw data from the <i>Orders </i>channel which is then output to the <i>Average
      </i>channel. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the raw <i>Orders </i>data and
    the <i>Average</i> which has been calculated by the <b>Average </b>analytic
    is fed into the <b>Spread </b>Analytic. The <b>Spread </b>analytic
    outputs the spread calculated from these two input streams. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>Threshold </b>analytic
    receives the output from the <b>Spread </b>analytic and outputs any data
    which is outside of the threshold (defined in its properties) to the <i>Breaches
      </i>channel. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Volatility Increase</b> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data from the <i>RAW_SENSOR_DATA</i>
    channel is received by the <b>Volatility</b> analytic which calculates the
    volatility using variance over a default 60 second time window. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The output is sent to a <b>Threshold</b>
    analytic which is detecting data breaches with a value greater than or equal
    to 25. These breaches are output to the <i>SENSOR_ANOMOLIES</i> channel.<b></b><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <u><b>How to use the Analytics Builder</b></u> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The analytics supplied with the <i>Industry
      Analytics Kit</i> are listed under their relevant categories (Detectors,
    Extensions, Flow Manipulation, GeoLocation, Streaming Calculations,
    Utilities).<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The categories can be expanded by
    clicking on the category name. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Adding an analytic to the
      Configuration Panel</u> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To add an analytic into the
    confguration panel, left click on the analytic in the Analytic Panel. Whilst
    holding down the left mouse button, drag and drop the the analytic over one
    of the grey drop areas in the Configuration Panel. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Moving an analytic on the
      Configuration Panel</u> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To move an analytic from one location
    to another in the configuration panel, left click on the analytic and drag
    it to a new grey drop location.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Copying an analytic</u> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To copy an analytic which is already
    in the Configuration Panel, left click to select the analytic. Whilst
    holding down the left mouse button, hold down the 'ctrl' button on the
    keyboard. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the analytic is dragged to a new
    grey drop location, it will be copied and not moved. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Deleting an analytic from the
      Configuration Panel</u> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left click on the
    analytic. Hold down the left mouse button and drag the analytic off the
    configuration panel. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b> <i> <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: A faster
        way to delete an analytic is to left click on the analytic. When it has
        been selected , press the 'del' key on the keyboard to delete the
        analytic. </i> </b> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Joining Analytics together </u> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an Analytic is dragged into the
    Configuration panel, the default input and output channels are automatically
    linked to the analytics which are to the left and right. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the analytic contains any optional
    channels, these need to be connected manually by clicking on the small white
    circle on the analytic.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Changing Channel names<br>
    </u>&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an analytic is dropped at the
    start of end of a row, the input channel name is defaulted to the input
    channel name defined for that analytic. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an analytic is dropped at the end
    of a row, the output channel name is defaulted to the output channel name
    defined for that analytic. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These default input and output
    channels can be renamed.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To select an input or output channel,
    hover the mouse over the channel name or blue circle in the configuration
    panel. When the mouse cursor changes to a hand pointer, left click to
    select. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the channel is selected, the
    right Properties Panel will display the 'Channel Properties' and the Channel
    Name property will be highlighted. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type in the Channel Name input field
    to change the name of the channel. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b> <i> Note: If you need to change
        more than one channel to the same channel name, update the first one,
        then select and drag the channel down onto the other channel locations</i>
    </b> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u> Changing the properties on an
      analytic </u> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An analytic can contain multiple
    properties which can be changed as required. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To change the properties of an analytic,
    select the analytic by left clicking on it in the Configuration Panel. When
    the analytic is selected, the 'Analytic Properties' will be displayed in the
    Properties Panel. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To change the property, click on the
    required field in the Analytic Properties panel. <br>
    <br>
