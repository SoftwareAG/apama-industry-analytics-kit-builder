    <h1>Analytics Builder Customising Guide</h1>
    <br>
    The Analytics Panel contains the analytics which have been provided with the
    Industry Analytics Kit. Where required, end users are also able to extend their
    Analytics Builder by adding their own custom analytics. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b> <u> Custom Analytics&nbsp; </u> <br>
      <br>
    </b>
    <ul>
      <li> Writing a custom analytic </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Industry
    Analytics Kit provides an analytic template which can be used as a starting
    point for writing a custom analytic. The analytic template is available
    inside the Industry Analytics Kit under the samples folder. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="Analytic Definition" src="images/analytic-definition.png">
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside the
    AnalyticTemplate.mon file is an @AnalyticDefinitions section which is read
    by the Analytics Builder when a custom analytic is loaded. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section
    provides the Analytics Builder with details such as the name of the
    analytic, the input and output channels and the analytic properties.
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the user is
    building the custom analytic, it is important that the details inside the
    @AnalyticDefinition correctly reflect the channels and properties which are
    used by the analytic. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, to ensure
    that the custom analytics are displayed separately from the default
    analytics, set the group in the @AnalyticDefinition to something like
    ‘Custom’. <br>
    <br>
    <b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the
        custom analytics can be displayed separately by using different group
        names in the @AnalyticDefinitions </i></b><br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li> Loading custom analytics into the Analytics Builder </li>
    </ul>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the custom
    analytic has been written, it can be loaded into the Analytic Builder. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To load a custom analytic
    into the Analytics Builder, click on the right most dropdown in the
    navigation bar. Under 'Custom Analytic', click on the 'Load' button <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select one or more
    custom analytic .mon files. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    @AnalyticDefinition definition from each of these files will be read and the
    custom analytics will now be displayed at the bottom of the Analytics Panel
    under the group you have defined in the @AnalyticDefinition <br>
    <br>
    <i> <b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note:
        &nbsp; When you load custom analytics into the Analytics Builder, this
        information is not sent outside of your local browser. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the browser
        window is refreshed, the custom analytics you have loaded will be lost
        and the original default analytics will be displayed. </b> </i> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <u><b>Custom Metadata</b></u> <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To prevent having to select and load
    all of your custom analytics each time the Analytics Builder web page is
    loaded, metadata export and import functionality has been provided. <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Exporting Metadata </b></li>
    </ul>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have
    imported all of your custom analytics, you can export all of the metadata
    into a custom metadata file. This file will contain the metadata for all of
    the supplied Analytics, plus the metadata for the custom analytics you have
    manually loaded using your .mon files. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To export the
    metadata, click on the right most drop-down in the navigation bar. Under
    'Metadata', click on the 'Export' button. This will immediately create a
    metadata.json file in your download folder. This file can be renamed to
    whatever you want to call your custom metadata. <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Importing Metadata </b></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reset the
    Analytics Builder back to the list of default analytics, we will need to
    press F5 <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, to load your
    custom metadata, click on the right most drop-down in the navigation bar.
    Under 'Metadata', click on the 'Import' button. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the
    metadata.json file you saved earlier and click on 'Open' <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Analytics Panel
    will now display the analytics and custom analytics from the metadata file <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <b> <u>Changing the Sample Metadata </u></b>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you export the metadata to the metadata.json file,
    the samples which are displayed in the 'SAMPLE' menu option in the menu bar
    are also stored into this file. These can be amended to display different
    samples. <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To change the samples : <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Find the .evt files (configuration
    files that you have saved previously) that you want to display in your
    Analytic Builder SAMPLES dropdown <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Open the metadata.json file which
    you have created using 'Exporting Metadata' above <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Before adding the sample to the
    metadata.json, you will need to escape the .evt data using a website such as
    <a href="https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html">https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Replace the existing sample data in
    the metadata.json file with your own escaped samples <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Save the metadata.json file <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. When you import the metadata using
    the 'Import Metadata' above, the samples in the SAMPLES drop-down will now
    contain your custom list of samples <br>
